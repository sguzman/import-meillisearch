  "abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

  "abstract": "  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\nAmerican Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\n",

  "abstract": "  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation\nrelations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has\ngained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck\nscale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

  "abstract": "  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for\napplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\n",

  "abstract": "  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

  "abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

  "abstract": "  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n",

  "abstract": "  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",

  "abstract": "  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized\nstripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved\nBrillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n",

We study the possibility\nof detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through\nmodulation effects in the $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock\nwaves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron\nfraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible\ndetectability of the neutronization $\\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\\bar\\nu_e$\nspectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant\nconversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for\nvery small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\\times 10^{-5}$.\n",

  "abstract": "  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete\ndipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n",

Numerical simulations of light scattering by\nspheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and\n2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.\nErrors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally\nincrease with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times\nincrease steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a\ncluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program\nis the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of\ncomputers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large\nparticles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current\nlimitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.\n",

  "abstract": "  The quadratic pion scalar radius, \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s, plays an important role\nfor present precise determinations of \\pi\\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\\'ain,\nusing an Omn\\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar\nform factor, obtains \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s=0.75\\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger\nthan the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es\nequations, \\la r^2\\ra^\\pi_s=0.61\\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both\nvalues, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\\'ain's method and\nshow that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under\ntiny changes in the input \\pi\\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for\nsome S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the\nresulting value is \\la r^2\\ra_s^\\pi=0.65\\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error\nin our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave\nI=0 \\pi\\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not\nyet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from\nQCD.\n",

  "abstract": "  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of\nRiemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a\nnatural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a\nclassical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then\nproving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)\nin the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on\na given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity\nassumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal\nobject in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth\nisometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct\na spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold\nwhich is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the\nquantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups\nof commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum\ndouble torus defined in \\cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of\nholomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.\n",

  "abstract": "  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\nBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\nblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n",

  "abstract": "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

  "abstract": "  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n",

  "abstract": "  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including\ninteracting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean\nquantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the\nisometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either\nself-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the\nself-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a\nunitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian\nmanifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose\nLorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.\n",

  "abstract": "  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the\ntheory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,\n$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,\n$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",
